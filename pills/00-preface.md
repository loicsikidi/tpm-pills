# Preface

## Motivation

When I started my journey with TPMs (*Trusted Platform Modules*), I experienced two conflicting emotions: `enthusiasm and confusion`. Indeed, the principle of TPM seemed brilliant to me, but I struggled to understand how I could actually put it into practice.

After several months of perseverance, and thanks to the valuable work of the community (i.e. tools, blog posts, etc.), I reached a level of understanding that could be considered acceptable. In hindsight, I can clearly say that my learning cost was too high, but **it doesn't necessarily have to be for everyone**.

That is why, I am taking on the challenge of producing a (relatively) comprehensive introduction to the subject. In short, the content I would have dreamed of having when I started this journey.

## What's `TPM Pills`?

<div class="info">
<b>Info</b>

<code class="hljs">TPM Pills</code> is a direct tribute to <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills" target="_blank"><code class="hljs">Nix Pills</code></a>, who has helped many people discover the <a href="https://nixos.org" target="_blank">nix</a> language!
</div>

A series of articles that gradually introduce the key concepts about a TPM. The goal is that by the end of reading `TPM Pills`, you will have a solid understanding of the functionalities offered by a TPM in order to reduce the complexity of TPM 2.0 specification[^1] if you find yourself reading it. Additionally, each article will be accompanied by a reproductible example to make things more concrete.

> *Note: `TPM Pills` will refer a bunch of time to the TPM 2.0 specification. Knowing that the latter evolves over time, we will use the latest version[^2] available at the time of writing.*  
>
> *The spec is also available in [here](https://github.com/loicsikidi/tpm-pills/tree/main/assets/resources) in the repository.*

Finally, it is important to emphasize that this content is **free**.

## Who is this for?

To anyone who wants to understand TPM and its functionalities. Whether you are a developer, a security expert, or just curious, you will find something to satisfy your curiosity.

<div class="warning">
<b>Warning</b>

A developer background is recommended especially for the implementation part.

## Who Am I?

I'm **Lo√Øc Sikidi** a *passionate software engineer* from France. I love to learn and share my (little bit of) knowledge with others.

I'm far from being an expert on the subject, but I want to contribute to the democratization of this technology because I'm convinced that the TPM is a powerful tool that can help us to build more secure systems.
