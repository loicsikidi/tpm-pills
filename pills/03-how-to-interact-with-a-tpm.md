# How to interact with a TPM?

## Introduction

It’s important to keep in mind that a TPM is primarily a **passive** device. By *“passive”*, I mean that a TPM will never act on its own—it always responds to a request. This behavior could be compared to a *REST API*, for example. The specification[^1] defines a set of commands (a little over a hundred) that a TPM must support, along with the associated interface contract.

In the <a href="02-install-tooling.html#example-validate-tpms-version" target="_blank">previous pill</a>, we used the `TPM2_GetCapability` command to display the TPM version. This command is very useful because it provides a set of information about a TPM (static data) and its current state (dynamic data). The two libraries (*tpm2-tools and go-tpm*) that we used did more or less the same thing:

1. The library created the `TPM2_GetCapability` command in accordance with the specification  
1. The command was sent to the TPM[^2]
1. The command was received and interpreted by the TPM  
1. The TPM produced a response in accordance with the specification  
1. The response was sent back to the client[^2]

## Local Access

Let’s take a closer look at the transmission part (steps 2 and 5), as this is a topic that’s often overlooked. The diagram above describes a somewhat simplistic interaction. In reality, a TPM client never has a direct connection to a TPM, which, let’s remember, is a physical device. It's the operating system that provides an interface to bridge the *userspace* and the *hardware*.

As we saw in <a href="01-why-tpm-is-super-dope.html" target="_blank">pill #1</a>, a TPM is characterized by being resource-efficient, which is why it does not natively manage *multi-tenancy* when several applications need to communicate concurrently with it. To address this issue, the TCG produced a specification (*<a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tss-tab-and-resource-manager/" target="_blank">TCG TSS 2.0 TAB and Resource Manager</a>*) describing how to implement this logic.

<div class="info">

<a href="https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-abrmd" target="_blank"><code class="hljs">tpm2-abrmd</code></a> is an implementation of that spec.
</div>

Adding this functionality unfortunately requires installing an additional tool on your machine and maintaining it in an operational state. Fortunately for us, starting from kernel version 4.12[^3], the *Resource Manager* is a service directly integrated into the OS—which greatly simplifies integration. In summary, if your application communicates with a TPM, it will generally follow the pattern below:

<div class="info">
<b>Info</b>

As you’ve noticed, the OS provides a new device named <code class="hljs">/dev/tpmrm0</code>. It is preferable to use it to take advantage of the features offered by the <em>Resource Manager</em>.
</div>

By default, the data flow is unencrypted; however, we’ll see in a dedicated pill how it is possible to encrypt it.


### Limitations

In most distributions, the *devices* dedicated to the TPM are owned by the `root` user.

This has significant implications, as it requires your application to be run with *root* privileges—an unacceptable situation in many contexts (e.g., general public usage). By comparison, a Yubikey will ask the user to enter a PIN or press the device to unlock access to keys, without the underlying driver requiring `root` privileges. The concept of authorization exists on a TPM, so there's fundamentally nothing preventing a *rootless* approach.

Unfortunately, there is no consensus on the subject that would allow all applications to communicate with a TPM in a *rootless* manner. As of now, the ***hack*** consists of requiring the user to install <a href="https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss" target="_blank">`tpm2-tss`</a> in order to benefit from its <a href="https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/blob/b6fd5147a0618019af0d1d6d597492014354da3b/dist/tpm-udev.rules" target="_blank">*udev rules*</a>, which have become a sort of unofficial standard. Admittedly, this method is not ideal, for two reasons:

1. It installs a binary that might not even be used  
2. `tpm2-tss` is not necessarily packaged on all distributions  

Nevertheless, it allows you to achieve the following result:

> *Note: in the different labs, we won’t be affected by this issue, as we’ll be using a Software TPM.*

### What about Windows?

Since Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the operating system includes TBS (*TPM Base Services*), which is an interface that centralizes access to the TPM through RPC calls[^4]. The following illustration shows the relationship between TBS and the TPM:

<p><img src="./images/03-pill/tbs-diagram.png" alt="TBS diagram" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"></p>
<p align="center"><em>source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devio/tpm-base-services</em></p>

<div class="info">
<b>Info</b>

For security reasons, TBS only accepts calls originating from the host machine.

## Remote Access

We’ve seen how to interact with a TPM locally, but is it possible to do so remotely? The answer is **yes**. `tpm2-tss` implements a number of *drivers*[^5] that enable remote access. There are two approaches—either via SSH access or via a TCP socket.

As an example, the TCP approach is the one used by many simulators such as:

* <a href="https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms" target="_blank">libtpms</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm" target="_blank">swtpm</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ms-tpm-20-ref" target="_blank">mssim</a>

The most important thing is to remember that this type of access exists. If your context requires it, keep in mind that establishing an encrypted channel is a prerequisite to prevent any *man-in-the-middle* attacks.

## Bonus: an exotic TPM

It's worth knowing that a TPM can also be located outside of a machine, for example... on a USB stick! That's the rather wild idea proposed by <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/193028-letstrust-tpm2go/details" target="_blank">LetsTrust-TPM2Go</a>, offering a portable TPM.

Technically, this is a TPM that responds to SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) inputs; then, *libusb* is used to connect the USB device with the host.

## Conclusion

In this pill, we’ve seen how we can interact with a TPM and, most importantly, the wide range of methods available to us—whether for local or remote access.

## Next pill...

...we will create our first key and discover how the TPM manages such resources.
